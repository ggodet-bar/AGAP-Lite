Patterns for documenting processes ?
====================================

Patterns are a specific type of documentation format, which focuses on three aspects:

- describing the circumstances under which the pattern should be used (i.e., the
  problem that the pattern could solve),
- describing the solution to the aforementioned problem,
- optionnally describing means to adapt the solution, e.g. depending on specific
  problem occurrences.

Thus, patterns enable building clear, straight to the point documentation. They allow 
for different styles of structure, from the informal -- e.g., a few paragraphs for
describing each category -- to the quasi formal -- e.g. using
classifications based on strict ontologies, which can actually be described using AGAPLite.
